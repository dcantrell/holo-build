v1.3 (2016-06-07)
=================

Deprecation notices:

- The `package.setupScript` and `package.cleanupScript` keys are deprecated.
  Use the new `[[action]]` syntax instead.
- The `package.definitionFile` key is deprecated, without replacement. See
  below.
- The `--(no-)reproducible` options are deprecated. All packages produced by
  holo-build are now fully reproducible.

New features:

- Package definitions can now contain `[[action]]` sections. This syntax
  replaces `package.setupScript` and `package.cleanupScript`.

Changes:

- `package.definitionFile` is not needed anymore (and deprecated, see above).
  The definition file's name is now derived from the package name by default.
- Packages are now always built fully reproducibly, so the `--reproducible`
  option is not needed anymore (and deprecated, see above).

Miscellaneous:

- Strip binaries during build.

v1.2 (2016-02-25)
=================

New features:

- Add RPM generator. RPMs will now be built automatically when running on RHEL,
  Fedora, SLES, openSUSE or Mageia. RPM support is considered experimental
  because of the abysmal state of documentation for the RPM package format.

Bugfixes:

- Fix version detection when building an unpacked release tarball.

Miscellaneous:

- Use golangvend to simplify the management of library dependencies.
- Share validation logic between generators.

v1.1.1 (2016-01-30)
===================

Bugfixes:

- Fix a bug which caused symlinks in packages to be unpacked as empty regular
  files.

v1.1 (2016-01-30)
=================

Changes:

- Packages are now built in memory, without constructing a temporary directory
  tree in the filesystem. This also means that the fakeroot dependency is gone.

Bugfixes:

- Fix a syntax error in the zsh autocompletion.
- Fix various small errors in the manpage.

v1.0 (2015-12-04)
=================

No changes compared to the beta release.

v1.0-beta.1 (2015-12-03)
========================

Changes:

- holo-build is now informed about the new plugin structure of Holo. When a
  package includes files below /usr/share/holo, it will now add automatic
  dependencies on the Holo plugins used, rather than on Holo itself. (The
  dependency on Holo is expected to be implied by the plugin package.)
